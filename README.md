# Webpack Starter Pack

To run the app locally, run:

    npm run build
    npm run webpack       # equivalent to build, or use…
    npm run webpack-watch # run webpack continuously while editing
    npm run web           # start HTTP server locally on ${PORT:-4000}

Source layout:

* `dist`: built app (HTTP content root)
* `src`: app sources (all languages)
    * `src/index.html`: the app's root page, minus script tags.
    * `src/app.jsx`: the app's entry point script.
    * `src/components.jsx`: the app's React components.
    * `src/components.less`: the components' style sheets, using Less.
* `web`: a trivial HTTP server for local development or deployment to Heroku.

Much of the rationale for these choices is laid out [here](http://grimoire.ca/).

Switch to Sass if you like.
